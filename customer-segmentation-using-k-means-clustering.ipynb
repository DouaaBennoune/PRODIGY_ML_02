Ultimately, this approach offers businesses a detailed visualization to better understand their customers, identify opportunities within their diverse consumer base, and adapt to their evolving needs. Additionally, it helps in retaining customers over time through effective systems, even before these visualizations enable companies to foster engagement and loyalty.
